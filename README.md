In the HTML file, I first changed the title of the web tab from website to Horiseon. I then changed several of the tags. Although the website was functioning properly with the tags the way they were, I changed many of them to either be more descriptive of what they were defining (for example changing div to section or main), or I changed them from a class to an element (for example changing div class=“header” to header). I added line spaces throughout to separate the different sections. I added alt descriptions with each img. I added an id to line 33 to make the navigation link function. I consolidated 6 class names down to 2 to streamline the CSS file.

In the CSS file, I removed the . in front of all the .header selectors because header was changed from a class to an element in the HTML file. Some of the selectors changed because the tags were changed in HTML (for example .content was changed to main). Since the 6 class names were consolidate to 2 in HTML, I was able to remove 12 redundant selectors in CSS.
